I am 25 years old, I currently live in Pisa and I am student of the Master of Science course in 
[Artificial Intelligence](https://didattica.di.unipi.it/laurea-magistrale-in-informatica/curricula/curriculum-artificial-intelligence/) 
at the Computer Science department, University of Pisa. 
In parallel, I am a researcher in Machine Learning e Data Science for migration studies and predictions at [HumMingBird](https://hummingbird-h2020.eu/about) - EU Horizon 2020 project.
I am also a tech writer for [Analytics Vidhya](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya) community on [Medium](https://medium.com/@d.goglia).
During my studies I gained deep expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Neural Network models. I also became really interested in AI ethics.
