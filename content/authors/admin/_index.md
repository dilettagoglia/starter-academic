I currently live in [Pisa](https://goo.gl/maps/WvUJxFbKdFVeU7rj9) and I am student of the Master's Degree course in [Artificial Intelligence](https://didattica.di.unipi.it/laurea-magistrale-in-informatica/curricula/curriculum-artificial-intelligence/) at the Computer Science department of the University of Pisa. 
During my studies I gained deep expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Neural Network models. I also became really interested in AI ethics.
I also have working experience as teaching assistant, as Web Designer and Developer, Social Media Editor and Content Creator.
In my private life I'm a proud [buddhist](https://www.sgi-italia.org/) and a bodybuilding athlete in [NBFI](https://www.nbfi.it/) federation.
