I am 25 years old, I currently live in Pisa and I am student of the Master of Science course in 
[Artificial Intelligence](https://didattica.di.unipi.it/laurea-magistrale-in-informatica/curricula/curriculum-artificial-intelligence/) 
at the Computer Science department, University of Pisa. 
I have working experience as researcher in Machine Learning e Data Science for migration studies and predictions at [HumMingBird](https://hummingbird-h2020.eu/about) - EU Horizon 2020 project.
I am also a tech writer for [Analytics Vidhya](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya) and [Towards AI](https://pub.towardsai.net/) communities on [Medium](https://medium.com/@d.goglia).
During my studies I gained deep expertise in Data Science, Deep Learning and Neural Network models. I also became really interested in AI ethics.

Member of [UU-InfoLab](https://uuinfolab.github.io) research group and [UU-CSSLab](https://uucsslab.github.io)
