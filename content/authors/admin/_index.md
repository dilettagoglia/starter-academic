I currently live in Pisa, Italy and I am student of the Master's Degree course in AI at University of Pisa. 
During my studies I gained deep expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Neural Network models. I also became really interested in the ethic field of Artificial Intelligence.
I have working experience as teaching assistant, as Web Designer and Developer, Social Media Editor and Content Creator.
In my free time I'm an activist and a bodybuilder athlete.
