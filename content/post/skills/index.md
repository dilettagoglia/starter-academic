# My skills

I have gained the following skills both developing university projects and working for external companies.


I listed down below my main skills and also some secondary ones, that I had the opportunity to learn over the years, through study and concrete application.



## Hard Skills

I have **advanced expertise** in:

* **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks**

  * Bayesian learning
  * Graphical and generative models (HMM, MRF)
  * Dynamic Bayesian networks
  * Deep learning techniques (CNN, Autoencoders, DBN, etc.)
  * Deep learning for machine vision and signal processing
  * Advanced neural networks (recurrent, recursive, ...) for learning and forecasting
  * Reinforcement learning
  * Signal processing and time-series analysis
  * Image processing, filters and visual feature detectors
* **Web Development & Desing**

  * HTML, CSS, XML, XHTML, XSL-T, RelaxNG, JavaScript
  * Client-side lanuages: JavaScript, TypeScript
  * Server-side languages: Python, PHP
  * Other languages: MatLab, LaTeX
  * Other tools: Flask, Google API, AJAX call, jQuery, JSON
  * MySQL for relational DBMS
  * Graphic Design & Brand Design
* **Semantic Web and Linked Open Data**

  * RDF, RSFS, OWL, SPARQL
* **Communication**

  * Social Network Management
  * Professional Writing: books, scientific papers
  * Data Journalism
  * Professional communication in scientific/technological areas
  * Producing and managing high-quality publications as well as web sites and portals
* **Tools**

  * Keras, Tensorflow, Anaconda (for ML and DL)
  * Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign
  * Kanban (for software development)

  * Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and all other Microsoft products



ðŸ‘‰ I also have minor expertise in:

* Software process management & technologies

  * Agile software development
  * Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering
* CMS management (Wordpress)



## Soft Skills

During my studies I completed a lot of different projects either by myself or **in a group** (both small and large groups). This had thaught me how to **efficiently collaborate** with collegues, and how to **organze and coordinate work** during development. I have learnt how to switch easily from **different environments and programming languages**. Also by working alone I improved my **autonomy** on **problem solving** and on researching new things by myself.

I constantly **keep myself updated** reading news, latest paper abouth technology and attending new courses about many different thematic areas.

Experience has also given to me these skills:

* Distance-working / Smartworking with structured tools to manage indivisual & teams work (es. Trello, Notion, Discord, Git, Asana)

  * Organize work remotely
  * Structure group work in Kanban style
* Great care for details
* Critical skills
* Precise organization and time management
* Public speaking, talks and public presentations
* Public relations
* Enthusiastic, positive and driven attitude
* Excellent organization and time management
* Ability to develop and manage project schedules
