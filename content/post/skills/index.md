### Soft Skills

During my studies I completed a lot of different projects either by myself or **in a group** (both small and large groups). This had taught me how to **efficiently collaborate** with colleagues, and how to **organize and coordinate work** during development. I have learnt how to switch easily from **different environments and programming languages**. Also by working alone I improved my **autonomy** on **problem solving** and on researching new things by myself.

I constantly **keep myself updated** by reading news and latest paper about technology and by attending new courses about many different thematic areas.

Experience has also given to me these skills:

* Distance-working / Smartworking with structured tools to manage both individual and team work (es. Trello, Notion, Discord, GitHub, Asana).
* Remote working organization
* Structure group work in Kanban style
* Great care for details
* Critical skills
* Precise organization and time management
* Public speaking, talks and presentations
* Public relations
* Enthusiastic, positive and driven attitude
* Ability to develop and manage project schedules

I also attended a specific [course about soft skills](http://contaminationlab.unipi.it/soft-skills-2021/) (see my [certificate]()), that taught me the importance of people and groups management, critical thinking and creativity, negotiation, coordination with others, judgment and decision making in any work environment.
