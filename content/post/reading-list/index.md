I'm a huge reader and I really love to share my past and current books and journals! 

Check my [personal reading list](https://www.notion.so/dilettagoglia/9ef7f994725441f78ce8639a40bf5167?v=7517264c82f540f6979bd54b91d081cf),
were you can find all the books I read in my free time, mostly about personal growth, AI and buddhism.

There also a [university reading list](https://www.notion.so/dilettagoglia/University-Reading-List-57f62cf948a6465497c3aedb171f58c8) where I collected all the books I used during my MSc journey, for preparing exams
building projects, and "approfondire" concepts.  


> Both these libraries are made using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). Enjoy!
