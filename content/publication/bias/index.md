abstract: "Riding the wave of the current #BlackLivesMatter movement, in this
  work I present an example of racial-based discrimination resulting from a
  particular kind of algorithmic bias, known in literature as amplification
  bias. Then, in order to stimulate debate on how to effectively address this
  phenomenon in automated decision-making systems, I explore a case study
  reporting it, I analyse why it is so problematic, and I stress the need to
  reflect on ethical solutions to fix it. In this paper, I argue that we cannot
  solve harmful consequences of algorithmic bias to the root without adopting an
  ethically-based approach. Hence my discussion emphasizes the need to urgently
  address these issues, proposes actions to do that and underlines the
  importance of rules and norms to keep human beings accountable. "
